#PhotoStats

This is a small utility that I hope will help identify approaches to optimize images in SizePhotos.
The output is intended to be opened in Excel/LibreOffice Calc in order to be plotted to look for trends.

## Using
`dnx run PhotoStats -p /home/user/Desktop/pictures/`

Arguments:
- p = directory containing the photos
